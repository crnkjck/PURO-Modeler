# Tools for ontology engineering with the help of PURO language

The project consists of two software tools

* [PURO Modeler](puromodeler.md) is a graphical editor of PURO models.
* [OBOWLMorph](obowlmorph.md) is a tool for transformation of PURO models into OWL ontology skeletons.

The tools share the same codebase, so download the whole project if you want to work with any of them.
